Important note about CVIDmmTest.prj

If this project file is opened and recompiled it is possible that CVI will issue errors
about "unable to find ividmm.fp". This is because when installing TestStand, the IVI 
Compliance Package (ICP) was not installed. In order to properly recompile, users will 
need to install the IVI Compliance Package (ICP) located on the National Instruments 
Device Driver CD-ROM that comes with TestStand.
