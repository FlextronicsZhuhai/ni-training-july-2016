Note: Activate the Word Wrap feature in your text editor if you open this file and a horizontal scrollbar appears.

AppWizard creates the AccessingArrays DLL, which not only demonstrates the basics of using the Microsoft Foundation classes but also is a starting point for writing your DLL, for you.

Each file that makes up the AccessingArrays DLL includes the following:

- AccessingArrays.h--The main header file, which declares the CAccessingArraysApp class, for the DLL. 

- AccessingArrays.cpp--The main DLL source file, which contains the CAccessingArraysApp class.

- AccessingArrays.rc--A listing of all the Microsoft Windows resources the program uses, including icons, bitmaps, and cursors stored in the RES subdirectory. You can directly edit this file in Microsoft Developer Studio.

- res\AccessingArrays.rc2--Contains resources Microsoft Developer Studio does not edit. Place all resources not editable by the resource editor in this file.

- AccessingArrays.def--Contains DLL information that must be provided to run with Microsoft Windows. This file defines parameters such as the name and description of the DLL and exports functions from the DLL.

- AccessingArrays.clw--Contains information ClassWizard uses to edit existing classes, add new classes, and store information needed to create and edit	message maps and dialog data maps and to create prototype member functions.

Other standard files include the following:

- StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp--Used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named AccessingArrays.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

- Resource.h--The standard header file, which defines new resource IDs. Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

Note: AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code to which you must add or which you must customize.
